    <h1>Hello JAMStack</h1>
    <p>My name is Zachary Hobbs and this is my second website ever!</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I have always enjoyed running, no matter how painful it has been. It helps me stay active and I enjoy pushing myself to get faster and faster times.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I was younger, I was pretty into solving rubiks cubes as fast as I could. I don't do it much anymore, but every once in a while I like to see if I'm still as good as I was</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whenever I have enough money, I will usually dedicate a free afternoon to a round of golf. I know it seems boring, but it makes for a peaceful afternoon and the sport can really humble you if you aren't careful!</p>
